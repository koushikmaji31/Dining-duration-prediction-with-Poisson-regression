# Poisson Regression for Dinner Time Prediction

## Overview

This Python script implements Poisson Regression from scratch to predict dinner completion times based on various features such as day, holiday, meal type, extras, and whether the meal is vegetarian or not. It also includes a comparison with an inbuilt Linear Regression model. 

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you have extracted the `CS23MTECH11002_&_AI23MTECH11004-foml-assignment-1` zip file.
2. Change directory to `question 1`:
   ```bash
   cd question 1
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook by running the command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `Question1.ipynb`.
5. Run the code cells for performing EDA and making predictions.
